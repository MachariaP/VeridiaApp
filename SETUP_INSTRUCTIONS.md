# Setup Instructions - CORS Fix Applied

## What Was Fixed

### 1. CORS Configuration
Fixed Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) errors that were blocking frontend requests to backend services:

- **user_service**: Removed unnecessary backend URLs from allowed origins
- **content_service**: Cleaned up CORS origins to only allow frontend
- **verification_service**: Changed from wildcard (`*`) to specific frontend origins
- **search_service**: Changed from wildcard (`*`) to specific frontend origins

All services now properly allow requests from:
- `http://localhost:3000` (default Next.js dev server)
- `http://127.0.0.1:3000` (alternative localhost)

### 2. Environment Configuration
Created `.env.local` file in `frontend_app/` with correct backend service URLs:
- User Service: `http://localhost:8000`
- Content Service: `http://localhost:8001`
- Verification Service: `http://localhost:8002`
- Search Service: `http://localhost:8003`

### 3. Documentation Cleanup
Removed 12 redundant documentation files to clean up the repository:
- Removed outdated fix documentation (CORS_FIX.md, QUICK_FIX.md, etc.)
- Removed implementation summaries and improvement notes
- Kept only 9 essential documentation files

## How to Start the Application

### Step 1: Verify Your Setup
Run the setup verification script:
```bash
./verify-setup.sh
```

This will check:
- ✓ Python and Node.js are installed
- ✓ Environment files are configured correctly
- ✓ Required ports are available

### Step 2: Start Backend Services

#### User Service (Port 8000)
```bash
cd user_service
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

#### Content Service (Port 8001)
```bash
cd content_service
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8001
```

#### Verification Service (Port 8002)
```bash
cd verification_service
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8002
```

#### Search Service (Port 8003)
```bash
cd search_service
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8003
```

### Step 3: Start Frontend (Port 3000)
```bash
cd frontend_app
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at: http://localhost:3000

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Test Login/Register
1. Open browser to http://localhost:3000
2. Navigate to Login page
3. Open browser console (F12)
4. Try to login with test credentials
5. You should NO LONGER see CORS errors like:
   ```
   ❌ Access to fetch at 'http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/login' 
      from origin 'http://localhost:3000' has been blocked by CORS policy
   ```

### 2. Verify API Calls Work
Check the browser console (F12) - you should see:
```
✓ POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/login - 200 OK
✓ GET http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/me - 200 OK
```

## Troubleshooting

### Still seeing CORS errors?
1. Make sure all backend services are running on correct ports
2. Restart the frontend dev server after any environment changes:
   ```bash
   cd frontend_app
   rm -rf .next
   npm run dev
   ```

### Port already in use?
Find and kill the process using the port:
```bash
# Check which process is using port 8000
lsof -i :8000

# Kill the process (replace PID with actual process ID)
kill -9 PID
```

### Database connection errors?
The services will run with SQLite/in-memory databases by default. For PostgreSQL/MongoDB:
1. Make sure the database server is running
2. Configure connection strings in service `.env` files

## What Changed in the Codebase

### Modified Files:
1. `user_service/app/main.py` - Updated CORS allowed origins
2. `content_service/app/main.py` - Updated CORS allowed origins
3. `verification_service/app/main.py` - Updated CORS allowed origins
4. `search_service/app/main.py` - Updated CORS allowed origins
5. `verify-setup.sh` - Updated to check for correct environment variables

### Deleted Files:
- API_ENHANCEMENTS.md
- ARCHITECTURE_FIX.md
- CHANGELOG_CORS_FIX.md
- CORS_FIX.md
- DESIGN_SUMMARY.md
- DISCOVERY_PAGE_IMPROVEMENTS.md
- DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md
- FIX_SUMMARY.md
- IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
- IMPROVEMENTS.md
- QUICK_FIX.md
- QUICK_START.md

### Created Files:
- `frontend_app/.env.local` - Environment configuration for frontend (gitignored)

## Notes

- The `.env.local` file is gitignored and will not be committed to the repository
- CORS is now configured for development (localhost). For production, update the allowed origins in each service's `main.py`
- All services use their own dedicated ports - ensure no other applications are using these ports
