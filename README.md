# VeridiaApp: Empowering Truth-Seekers in a World of Information Overload

VeridiaApp is a dynamic, mobile-first platform designed for truth-seekers, researchers, and content creators. It enables users to create, share, and discover verified, AI-assisted content through a community-driven ecosystem. Built with a microservices architecture and a headless approach, VeridiaApp ensures scalability, flexibility, and resilience while prioritizing user privacy, content verification, and seamless integration with emerging technologies.

## Project Overview
VeridiaApp aims to revolutionize how users engage with information by:
- **Empowering Creation:** Tools for generating and verifying content with AI assistance.
- **Fostering Community:** Collaborative features for discussions, voting, and real-time interactions.
- **Driving Discovery:** Advanced search and recommendation engines powered by AI and user feedback.

Our target audience includes journalists, educators, researchers, and everyday users seeking reliable information.

## Architecture
VeridiaApp follows a **microservices architecture** with a **headless approach**:
- **Backend:** Composed of independent microservices (e.g., `user_service` for authentication and profiles, future services for content management, search, etc.). Each service is deployable separately for better scalability.
- **Frontend:** A separate Next.js/React application (`frontend_app`) that consumes backend APIs, allowing for easy updates and potential multi-platform support (web, mobile).
- **Infrastructure:** Containerized with Docker, orchestrated via Kubernetes on AWS EKS, with Elasticsearch for search, RabbitMQ for messaging, and databases like PostgreSQL (structured data) and MongoDB (unstructured data).

## Getting Started
For detailed setup instructions:
- Backend microservices: See individual service directories (e.g., `user_service/README.md`).
- Frontend: See `frontend_app/README.md`.
- Clone the repo, navigate to sub-directories, and follow their respective guides.

## Key Technologies
- **Backend:** Python, FastAPI, Pydantic, SQLAlchemy (PostgreSQL), MongoDB, JWT for auth, RabbitMQ for events.
- **Frontend:** Next.js, React JSX, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript.
- **Infrastructure:** Docker, Kubernetes, AWS (EKS, S3, etc.).
- **Search & AI:** Elasticsearch, potential integrations with AI models for verification.
- **Other:** Git for version control, CI/CD pipelines (future).
