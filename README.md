# VeridiaApp: Empowering Truth-Seekers in a World of Information Overload

VeridiaApp is a dynamic, mobile-first platform designed for truth-seekers, researchers, and content creators. It enables users to create, share, and discover verified, AI-assisted content through a community-driven ecosystem. Built with a microservices architecture and a headless approach, VeridiaApp ensures scalability, flexibility, and resilience while prioritizing user privacy, content verification, and seamless integration with emerging technologies.

## Project Overview
VeridiaApp aims to revolutionize how users engage with information by:
- **Empowering Creation:** Tools for generating and verifying content with AI assistance.
- **Fostering Community:** Collaborative features for discussions, voting, and real-time interactions.
- **Driving Discovery:** Advanced search and recommendation engines powered by AI and user feedback.

Our target audience includes journalists, educators, researchers, and everyday users seeking reliable information.

## Architecture
VeridiaApp follows a **microservices architecture** with a **headless approach**:

### Backend Microservices
- **user_service** (Port 8000): User authentication, registration, and profile management using PostgreSQL
- **content_service** (Port 8001): Content lifecycle management (creation, retrieval) using MongoDB
- **verification_service** (Port 8002): Community voting, discussions, and AI verification using PostgreSQL
- **search_service** (Port 8003): Full-text search and discovery using Elasticsearch

### Frontend
- **frontend_app**: Next.js/React application with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
  - Authentication flow with JWT tokens
  - Protected dashboard with user profile
  - Content submission interface
  - Content detail pages with voting and discussions
  - Discovery/search interface

### Infrastructure
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL (user_service, verification_service), MongoDB (content_service), Elasticsearch (search_service)
- **Messaging:** RabbitMQ for event-driven communication between services
- **Containerization:** Docker for all services
- **Future:** Kubernetes orchestration on AWS EKS

### Event-Driven Architecture
Services communicate asynchronously via RabbitMQ:
1. **ContentCreated** events: Published by content_service, consumed by verification_service and search_service
2. **StatusUpdated** events: Future enhancement for real-time status updates

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+ (for backend services)
- Node.js 18+ (for frontend)
- MongoDB 6.0+ (optional - defaults to in-memory storage)
- PostgreSQL 14+ (optional - defaults to SQLite)
- Elasticsearch 8.x (optional - defaults to in-memory storage)
- RabbitMQ 3.x (optional - currently stubbed)

**Note:** Most external services are optional. The application can run with just Python and Node.js installed, using SQLite for databases and in-memory storage for other services.

### Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MachariaP/VeridiaApp.git
   cd VeridiaApp
   ```

2. Start backend services (each in a separate terminal):
   ```bash
   # User Service (Port 8000)
   cd user_service
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
   
   # Content Service (Port 8001)
   cd content_service
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8001
   
   # Verification Service (Port 8002)
   cd verification_service
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8002
   
   # Search Service (Port 8003)
   cd search_service
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8003
   ```

3. Start frontend:
   ```bash
   cd frontend_app
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Access the application:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - User Service API: http://localhost:8000/docs
   - Content Service API: http://localhost:8001/docs
   - Verification Service API: http://localhost:8002/docs
   - Search Service API: http://localhost:8003/docs
