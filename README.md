## 🗄️ 4. Database Design Overview

**Key Entities:**

* **User** - Stores user account information including authentication credentials, profile data, roles, and permissions. Includes fields for email, hashed passwords, role assignments (admin, moderator, user), account creation timestamps, and GDPR-related data export/deletion tracking.

* **Content** - Represents submitted content items requiring verification. Contains content text, metadata, submission timestamp, author reference, current verification status (pending, verified, disputed, false), vote counts, and rich media attachments.

* **Vote** - Records individual user votes on content verification. Tracks user ID, content ID, vote type (authentic, false, unsure), vote timestamp, and optional reasoning/evidence provided by the voter.

* **Comment** - Stores user comments and discussions on content items. Includes comment text, author reference, content reference, parent comment ID (for threaded discussions), timestamps, and moderation status.

* **VerificationResult** - Aggregates verification outcomes combining community votes and AI analysis. Contains overall verification score, confidence level, AI analysis results, final status determination, and audit trail.

* **SearchIndex** - Elasticsearch documents optimized for full-text search. Includes indexed content text, metadata, tags, categories, popularity scores, and relevance boosting factors.

* **AuditLog** - Tracks all significant user actions for GDPR compliance and security auditing. Records action type, user ID, affected resources, timestamps, IP addresses, and change details.

**Relationships:**

* **User → Content (One-to-Many)**: A single user can submit multiple content items for verification. This relationship tracks content ownership and enables user-specific content management, allowing users to view their submission history and manage their contributed content.

* **User → Vote (One-to-Many)**: Each user can cast multiple votes across different content items, but only one vote per content item (enforced at database level with unique constraint). This ensures fair voting while preventing vote manipulation and enabling vote history tracking for reputation systems.

* **Content → Vote (One-to-Many)**: A single content item receives multiple votes from different users. Votes are aggregated to calculate overall verification scores, confidence levels, and final verification status. The relationship supports real-time vote counting and dynamic verification status updates as votes accumulate.

## ✨ 5. Feature Breakdown

* **User Authentication & Authorization**: Comprehensive JWT-based authentication system with secure registration, login, logout, and password reset flows. Implements refresh token rotation, token expiration management, and role-based access control (RBAC) for different permission levels (admin, moderator, user). Includes OAuth 2.0 preparation for future social login integration.

* **Content Submission & Management**: Full content lifecycle management allowing users to submit text, images, videos, and URLs for verification. Supports content categorization, tagging, and metadata enrichment. Provides draft saving, edit history tracking, and content withdrawal capabilities for content owners.

* **Community Voting System**: Democratic verification mechanism where users vote on content authenticity with options: authentic, false, or unsure. Each vote can include supporting evidence, reasoning, and confidence levels. Implements vote weighting based on user reputation and expertise, with real-time vote aggregation and verification status calculation.

* **Comment & Discussion Threads**: Robust commenting system supporting threaded discussions on content items. Enables users to provide context, share evidence, and engage in constructive debate about content authenticity. Includes comment moderation, reporting, nested replies, and markdown formatting support.

* **AI-Powered Verification Assistant**: Automated content analysis using natural language processing and machine learning models to detect common misinformation patterns, check against known fact databases, and provide preliminary authenticity scores. AI suggestions complement human judgment rather than replacing it.

* **Advanced Search & Discovery**: Elasticsearch-powered full-text search with fuzzy matching, typo tolerance, and relevance scoring. Supports filtering by category, verification status, date range, popularity, and custom sorting. Includes autocomplete suggestions, search history, and personalized content recommendations.

* **Real-time Notifications**: Event-driven notification system using RabbitMQ for instant updates on vote changes, verification status updates, comment replies, and content mentions. Supports in-app notifications, email alerts, and webhook integrations for third-party systems.

* **GDPR Compliance Tools**: Complete data privacy controls including user data export (JSON/CSV formats), right to be forgotten (complete data deletion), consent management, audit trail access, and data processing transparency. All user actions are logged for compliance auditing.

* **Admin Dashboard & Moderation**: Comprehensive administrative interface for content moderation, user management, system monitoring, and configuration. Includes tools for reviewing flagged content, managing user roles, viewing analytics, and configuring system parameters.

* **Rate Limiting & Abuse Prevention**: Multi-layered protection against API abuse including per-user rate limiting, IP-based throttling, CAPTCHA integration for suspicious activities, and automated bot detection to ensure fair usage and system stability.

## 🔒 6. API Security Overview

* **JWT Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens provide stateless, scalable authentication across all microservices. Access tokens expire after 15 minutes to minimize exposure risk, while refresh tokens enable seamless session extension. Tokens are signed using RS256 algorithm with rotating keys, and include user ID, roles, and permissions in claims for efficient authorization checks without database lookups.

* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Granular permission system defining three primary roles - Admin (full system access), Moderator (content management and user moderation), and User (standard content interaction). Each API endpoint enforces role requirements, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive operations like user deletion or system configuration changes.

* **Input Validation & Sanitization**: All incoming API requests undergo strict validation using Pydantic models in FastAPI. Data types, formats, lengths, and patterns are enforced at the schema level. User-provided content is sanitized to prevent XSS attacks, SQL injection, and NoSQL injection. File uploads are validated for type, size, and scanned for malware.

* **Rate Limiting**: Multi-tier rate limiting protects against abuse and ensures fair resource allocation. Implemented using Redis-backed token bucket algorithm with different limits for authenticated vs. anonymous users. Standard users limited to 100 requests/minute, while premium users may have higher limits. Returns 429 status with Retry-After headers when limits exceeded.

* **HTTPS/TLS Encryption**: All API communication enforces HTTPS with TLS 1.3 for data in transit. HTTP requests are automatically redirected to HTTPS. Strong cipher suites configured, and certificate pinning implemented for mobile clients to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

* **CORS Configuration**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing configured with whitelist approach, allowing only approved frontend domains. Credentials (cookies, authorization headers) only accepted from trusted origins. Preflight requests properly handled for complex CORS scenarios.

* **API Versioning**: URL-based versioning (e.g., /api/v1/) ensures backward compatibility while enabling evolution. Critical breaking changes result in new version release with migration guides. Old versions maintained for deprecation period (minimum 6 months) with sunset headers informing clients of timeline.

* **Security Headers**: Comprehensive security headers including Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Strict-Transport-Security, and X-XSS-Protection to defend against common web vulnerabilities and provide defense-in-depth.

* **Audit Logging**: All security-relevant events logged including authentication attempts (successful and failed), authorization denials, data access, and modifications. Logs include timestamps, user IDs, IP addresses, user agents, and request details for forensic analysis and compliance auditing.

## 🚀 7. CI/CD Pipeline Overview

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) automates the software delivery process, enabling rapid, reliable, and repeatable deployments while maintaining code quality and system stability. For VeridiaApp, CI/CD is critical to managing the complexity of a microservices architecture where multiple services must be independently tested, built, and deployed in coordination.

The CI/CD pipeline is implemented using **GitHub Actions** as the primary automation platform, chosen for its native GitHub integration, extensive marketplace of pre-built actions, and flexible workflow definition. Each service has its own workflow defined in YAML that triggers on specific events (push, pull request, tag creation) to the relevant service directories.

**Continuous Integration (CI)** phase begins when code is pushed to any branch. Automated workflows execute linting (Black, flake8 for Python; ESLint, Prettier for TypeScript), run comprehensive test suites (unit, integration tests with pytest and Jest), perform security scanning using tools like Bandit and npm audit, and build Docker images to verify containerization. Code coverage reports are generated and must meet the 80% threshold. All checks must pass before code can be merged to the main branch via pull request.

**Continuous Deployment (CD)** phase activates when code is merged to the main branch or a release tag is created. The pipeline automatically builds production Docker images with proper versioning, pushes images to container registries (AWS ECR, Google Container Registry, or Docker Hub), updates Kubernetes manifests or ECS task definitions, and deploys to staging environment first for smoke testing. Upon successful staging validation, deployment proceeds to production with rolling update strategy to ensure zero-downtime. Database migrations are executed automatically with rollback capability if failures occur.

The pipeline includes **environment-specific configurations** managed through GitHub Secrets and environment variables, ensuring sensitive credentials never appear in code. Infrastructure provisioning uses Terraform or CloudFormation for reproducible, version-controlled infrastructure changes. Monitoring integration with tools like Datadog or Prometheus alerts the team of deployment issues, automatically rolling back on critical errors. The entire process from code commit to production deployment typically completes in 10-15 minutes for individual services, enabling multiple deployments per day with confidence.
